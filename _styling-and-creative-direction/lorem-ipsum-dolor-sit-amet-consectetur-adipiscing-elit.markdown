# One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself *transformed* in his bed into [a horrible vermin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin "Vermin on Wikipedia"). He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

## The bedding was hardly able to cover it.

The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, link waved about helplessly as he looked. “What's happened to me?” he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.

First he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, get dressed, above all have breakfast, and only then consider further action, for (he noticed this clearly) by thinking things over in bed he would not reach a reasonable conclusion.

He remembered that he had already often felt a light pain or other in bed, perhaps the result of an awkward lying position, which later turned out to be purely imaginary when he stood up, and he was eager to see how his present fantasies would gradually dissipate.
